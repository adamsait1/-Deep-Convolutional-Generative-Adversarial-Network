Data
In this we will use the Celeb-A Faces dataset which can be downloaded at the linked site, or in Google Drive. 
The dataset will download as a file named img_align_celeba.zip.  link  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pTUZsaXdaSnZBZzg
Once downloaded, create a directory named celeba and extract the zip file into that directory. 
Then, set the dataroot input for this notebook to the celeba directory you just created. 
The resulting directory structure should be:
/path/to/celeba
    -> img_align_celeba
        -> 188242.jpg
        -> 173822.jpg
        -> 284702.jpg
        -> 537394.jpg
           ...
